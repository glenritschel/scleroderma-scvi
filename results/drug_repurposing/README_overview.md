# Drug-repurposing overview

*Updated:* 2025-09-17

This figure summarizes our LINCS reversal analysis for scleroderma skin single-cell states.

- **A.** Composite priority of candidate compounds (higher is better).
- **B.** Heatmap of max LINCS reversal per cell type for the top compounds.
- **C.** Selectivity of fibro/myofibro vs. other cell types plotted against the breadth of affected cell types.

**Headline findings**
- MEK/ERK pathway inhibition (e.g., **PD-0325901**, **PD-184352**) ranks consistently high.
- **BET bromodomain** and **PLK1** inhibition emerge as additional mechanisms.
- Rankings are robust to selectivity weighting; dose/time metadata are limited for some compounds.

*Caveats:* LINCS cell contexts differ from primary skin cell states; some drug targets are absent from the HVG matrix (checked against `.raw` where possible).
